      <h2>About This Site</h2>
      <h4>History</h4>
      <p>This repository is curated by Statistics for Sustainable Development, and is a collection of resources developed over 35 years of supporting research and eduction in statistics and data maangement.</p>
      <p>Stats4SD has its roots within the Statistical Services Centre (University of Reading), and the two organisations have a huge archive of resources, many of which were created under open licences with the intention of sharing with the world. While many of these reosurces are available in different places, we realised that we needed a central location where our entire catalogue could be made available to anyone who had need of it.</p>
      <h4>The Collection</h4>
      <p>So far we have added nearly 100 different resources to this site, which include resources from 2 online training courses and sets of videos exploring concepts around agricultural research practices. We still have a huge amount to upload, and it's going to take time for us to properly organise and tag everything we have in our archives. We don't know when we'll have everything up online, but we'll be adding new resources regularly over the next few months, and sorting through the existing uploads to better organise them as we go.</p>
      <p>Our aim is to make it as easy as possible for you to find the things that are useful to you, and will be updating both the site itself and the contents of the site regularly throughout the first half of 2018.</p>
      <p>To keep up to date with our progress, you can follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/stats4sd">Twitter</a> and check out our <a href="https://stats4sd.org/blog/">blog</a>, where we'll be posting updates about new resource collections and site updates.</p>
      <h4>Open Development</h4>
      <p>We believe in openness and transparancy throughout research and development processes. We're keen on the use of open licences for enabling sharing of resources, ideas and research outputs within the wider community, and most of the things Stats4SD produces are openly licenced. The entire code for this site is available on Github, and as we develop and learn, we're doing our best to document our experiences.</p>
      <h4>More Information</h4>

      <p>Many of the resources on this site came from the <a href="https://reading.ac.uk/ssc">Statistical Services Centre</a> at the University of Reading. Click the link to go to their website and learn more.</p>
